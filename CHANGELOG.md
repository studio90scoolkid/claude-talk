# Changelog

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **CLI binary discovery on other machines** — `~/.local/bin/` added to search paths (where `claude install` places the binary), plus `npm prefix -g` fallback for non-standard npm setups
- **Gemini auth check too strict** — `oauth_creds.json` is now checked directly regardless of `settings.json` authType field, fixing false "not authenticated" on some Gemini CLI versions
- **Cross-platform support** — Windows-compatible binary paths (`.cmd`), `where` instead of `which`, `os.homedir()` instead of `process.env.HOME`, and platform-aware PATH separators

### Changed
- Claude auth check now verifies CLI is callable (`--version`) before running `auth status`, with better text-based fallback parsing for non-JSON output
- Improved debug logging for auth checks in Output panel (`AI Debate` channel)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Collapsible settings panel** — toggle button (▲/▼) to collapse/expand agent configuration, keeping the UI compact during debates
- Settings panel collapse state persists across sessions via auto-save
- i18n support for collapse/expand tooltips (EN, KO, JA, ZH)

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Privacy policy** — dedicated `PRIVACY.md` covering data flows, Code Mode file access, model training policies, and third-party service disclaimers
- **Telemetry disabled by default** — Claude CLI (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1`) and Gemini CLI (`GEMINI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`, `GEMINI_TELEMETRY_LOG_PROMPTS=false`) telemetry is now automatically disabled for all spawned CLI processes
- **Privacy & Data Usage** section in README with provider-specific training policies, environment variable details, and link to full privacy policy

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Webview state persistence** — debate messages, settings, thinking indicator, and consensus gauge now survive window detach/reattach and auxiliary window moves
- `WebviewPanelSerializer` registration so VS Code can restore the panel after window moves without losing the running debate
- `onWebviewPanel:aiDebate` activation event for reliable panel deserialization
- Chat messages are now persisted to `globalState` (disk) as a fallback when in-memory state is lost during extension restarts
- `requestState` / `restoreState` message pair — webview always requests authoritative state from the extension host on init
- Shared `DebateManager` — the debate engine instance is reused across panel dispose/revive cycles so running debates are not interrupted

### Fixed
- **Window detach/reattach losing all UI state** — moving the panel to a separate window or between editor groups no longer resets the debate to the initial screen
- Thinking indicator ("...") now restored after window move when a debate is running
- Welcome screen no longer persists behind restored messages after a window move
- Turn counter no longer double-increments on retry — `turnCount` is now derived from history length instead of being mutably incremented
- `buildFollowUpPrompt` safety fallback when called with empty history (treats as first turn instead of crashing)

### Changed
- `DebatePanel.dispose()` no longer stops the debate or destroys the `DebateManager` — only removes event listeners so the panel can be revived with state intact
- `DebateSettings` interface extended with `providerA`, `providerB`, `seekConsensus`, `showSummary`, `allowConcession` fields
- HTML-escape agent names and summary text before `innerHTML` insertion to prevent XSS
- Stopped banner deduplication — `updateState('stopped')` now checks for existing `stopped-banner` elements and accepts a `skipBanner` parameter for restore paths

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Code Mode** — new toggle button (`GEN` / `</>`) before the topic input that switches between general debate and codebase-aware debate
- In Code Mode, agents explore the workspace using file-reading tools (Read, Grep, Glob) and ground their arguments in actual code
- Claude agents get `--allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob` with `cwd` set to the workspace root (read-only access)
- Gemini agents get `--sandbox` with `cwd` set to the workspace root
- Code-analysis system prompt instructs agents to reference file paths, function names, and short code snippets
- Mode persists across sessions via settings auto-save
- i18n for mode button tooltips and code-mode placeholder (EN, KO, JA; others fallback to English)
- Error message when Code Mode is used without an open workspace folder

### Changed
- Stronger language enforcement for Gemini — `CRITICAL LANGUAGE REMINDER` appended at the end of both first-turn and follow-up prompts to prevent language mismatch (e.g., Korean responses to English topics)

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Concession system** — agents can now concede defeat when they have no valid counterargument left, auto-stopping the debate with a concession banner
- "Allow Concession" checkbox (enabled by default) with i18n support for all 30+ languages
- Late-game strategy hints (turn 6+) now remind agents of the `[CONCEDE]` option to prevent endless wrap-up loops

### Changed
- Extracted shared prompt logic into `promptBuilder.ts` — eliminates ~300 lines of duplication between ClaudeAgent and GeminiAgent
- "Moderator Summary" renamed to "Summary" across all UI labels, banners, and loading text in all 30+ languages
- "Debate Ended" banner no longer appears when consensus or concession banner is already shown
- Stronger language enforcement for Gemini — explicit language rule repeated in first-turn and follow-up prompts

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Complete overhaul of debate system prompts for natural, conversational tone — agents now sound like sharp friends arguing, not academics writing papers
- Language-specific tone guides for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English with concrete register examples (e.g., ~거든/~잖아 for Korean, contractions for English)
- Persona prompts rewritten with distinct personalities and argumentation styles for Pro, Neutral, and Con
- First-turn prompt redesigned to produce direct openers instead of generic "I believe" statements
- Follow-up turn structure changed from rigid 3-part format to natural response flow
- Moderator summary prompt updated to neutral recap style (no more "audience" or "viewers" references)
- Provider auth checks now run independently — UI unlocks per-provider as each check completes
- Start button enables as soon as selected providers are ready, without waiting for all checks

### Added
- Em-dash (—) ban enforced in prompts to prevent unnatural punctuation
- Anti-flattery and anti-rhetorical-question rules to maintain debate tension
- `updateStartBtnState()` function for smarter start button state management
- Per-provider `providerReady` message type for incremental UI updates

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Structured debate flow — each turn now requires agents to directly rebut opponent's claim, present new evidence, and pose a challenge
- Debate progress tracking — follow-up prompts include a summary of recent arguments from both sides to prevent repetition
- Opponent message cap raised from 600 to 1000 characters for better context retention
- System prompt now enforces "engage with opponent's specific claims first" rule

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

### Added
- "Debate Ended" banner in chat area when debate is stopped — red-themed, matching consensus banner style, with i18n for all 27 languages
- Minimum width constraint on setup panel and agent config containers to prevent layout collapse on narrow windows

### Fixed
- Checkbox options no longer wrap to the next line when window is narrowed (`flex-wrap: nowrap`, `flex-shrink: 0`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Consensus gauge — real-time progress bar in the status bar showing how close agents are to agreement
- Self-reported consensus scoring — each agent rates agreement level (0-100) via `[CONSENSUS:XX]` marker every turn
- Color-coded gauge transitions: red (0-30%) → yellow (30-60%) → green (60-100%)
- Full i18n for consensus gauge label across all 32 languages

### Changed
- **Natural consensus flow** — removed rigid turn-based consensus forcing; agents now debate genuinely and only converge when truly persuaded
- Consensus strategy hints extended from 5 to 9+ turns for deeper discussions before agreement
- Consensus only triggers when both agents report 70%+ agreement (previously triggered after ~3 turns)
- Gauge only updates after both agents have reported at least one score
- Agent names are now locked (disabled) during active debate

### Fixed
- Moderator summary from previous debate leaking into new debate — summary process is now tracked and killed on stop/restart

- Gemini authentication check via local config files (`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `oauth_creds.json`) — zero token cost
- Bottom status bar shows agent model matchup during debate (e.g., "Agent A: Sonnet vs Agent B: Gemini 2.5 Pro")
