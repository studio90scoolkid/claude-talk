# Changelog

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Concession system** — agents can now concede defeat when they have no valid counterargument left, auto-stopping the debate with a concession banner
- "Allow Concession" checkbox (enabled by default) with i18n support for all 30+ languages
- Late-game strategy hints (turn 6+) now remind agents of the `[CONCEDE]` option to prevent endless wrap-up loops

### Changed
- Extracted shared prompt logic into `promptBuilder.ts` — eliminates ~300 lines of duplication between ClaudeAgent and GeminiAgent
- "Moderator Summary" renamed to "Summary" across all UI labels, banners, and loading text in all 30+ languages
- "Debate Ended" banner no longer appears when consensus or concession banner is already shown
- Stronger language enforcement for Gemini — explicit language rule repeated in first-turn and follow-up prompts

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Complete overhaul of debate system prompts for natural, conversational tone — agents now sound like sharp friends arguing, not academics writing papers
- Language-specific tone guides for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English with concrete register examples (e.g., ~거든/~잖아 for Korean, contractions for English)
- Persona prompts rewritten with distinct personalities and argumentation styles for Pro, Neutral, and Con
- First-turn prompt redesigned to produce direct openers instead of generic "I believe" statements
- Follow-up turn structure changed from rigid 3-part format to natural response flow
- Moderator summary prompt updated to neutral recap style (no more "audience" or "viewers" references)
- Provider auth checks now run independently — UI unlocks per-provider as each check completes
- Start button enables as soon as selected providers are ready, without waiting for all checks

### Added
- Em-dash (—) ban enforced in prompts to prevent unnatural punctuation
- Anti-flattery and anti-rhetorical-question rules to maintain debate tension

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Consensus gauge — real-time progress bar in the status bar showing how close agents are to agreement
- Self-reported consensus scoring — each agent rates agreement level (0-100) via `[CONSENSUS:XX]` marker every turn

- Full i18n for consensus gauge label across all 32 languages

### Changed
- **Natural consensus flow** — removed rigid turn-based consensus forcing; agents now debate genuinely and only converge when truly persuaded

- Gauge only updates after both agents have reported at least one score

- Gemini authentication check via local config files (`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `oauth_creds.json`) — zero token cost
